# THE MAZE PROJECT 
The Maze is a game that involves moving around walls finding the right path to the end point, thats why the name the maze since it involves solving a puzzle out of the walls. Its coded in SDL2 in 2D but i used raycasting to 3D

## Installation:

## About
I was inspired to embark on this project through the perssion of learning new coding languages and extensions. And when SDL2 and Raycasting came up, I thoght I should try it and its AWESOME. I inend to learn more of it and make more improvements on this game and more that I will develop.
Also this project is one of the projects for Holberton School projects and task required for software engineering course. https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/133
